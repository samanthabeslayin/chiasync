# chiasync
simple batch file that syncs Chia (1.1.5) 
Very simple to operate.  Contains two batch files

1) nodes.bat  -  place this inside of your Chia Daemon folder:
      -->  C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME_GOES_HERE\AppData\Local\chia-blockchain\app-1.1.5\resources\app.asar.unpacked\daemon
      -->  Note:  If you are not using 1.1.5 then change the app directory here ^^^
2) start_nodes.bat - place this on your desktop and double click it to perform the sync
      -->  Change the file directory and App to match the location of the nodes.bat file
      -->  C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME_GOES_HERE\AppData\Local\chia-blockchain\app-1.1.5\resources\app.asar.unpacked\daemon
      
After both batches are updated, double cliick the "nodes.bat" file and your Chia sync issues will disappear.
