ChiaSync for Windows 10 

Contains a batch file that you simply need to drop into your Chia folder.  Then make a shortcut to the batch file and double click it and you are good to go. 

All of the nodes were updated 5/20/2021 via https://chia.powerlayout.com/ filtering only the USA nodes.  If you are not in the USA, then you will want to update the node IPs in 'nodes.bat' for optimum connections. 

1) Place 'nodes.bat' inside of your Chia Daemon folder:

C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME_GOES_HERE\AppData\Local\chia-blockchain\app-1.1.5\resources\app.asar.unpacked\daemon\
      
-->  Note:  If you are not using 1.1.5 then change the app directory here ^^^

2) Copy a shortcut to your desktop 

Right click 'nodes.bat' and click copy.

Right click on your Desktop and click "Paste Shortcut"

Now anytime you have sync issues just run the batch file.

Enjoy Sync'd Chia Farming!
